# UN-People-Migration-Data-Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing the data to get insights on the migration dynamics, addressing questions such as: 
- What are the major flows of migration (meaning from where to where)?
- What are the dynamics of migration by Income, Regional Development and Geographic location?
- What is distribution in the total number of migrations from the years 1990 to 2020?

This study will address the above questions for cumulative values for 3 decades (1990-2020).
